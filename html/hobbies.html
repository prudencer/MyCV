                Why I Love News and Documentaries

              Staying informed and intellectually engaged has always been important to me.
              Watching news and documentaries refreshes my mind and helps me grow both personally and professionally.
              One way I nurture this curiosity is through watching news and documentaries. These aren't just passive pastimes; they're windows 
            into the world tools for understanding science, history, current affairs, and technology through real-life storytelling. This exercise
          both refreshes my mind and helps to develop personally and career-wise. It is quite interesting to understand how the world operates,
          how countries interact, and most importantly, how the global economies progress, what in our daily lives affect the economy and having
          a sort of a window into the future i.e. with the current US tarrif war, I can anticipate trade to be affected and prices to rise, 
          therefore I should start being vigilent with my finances before the worst is imminent.

              Science documentaries allow me to explore the universe from black holes to genetic engineering. Platforms like <em>CuriosityStream</em> 
          and <em>BBC Earth</em> offer engaging, fact-based content that ignites wonder and a hunger for discovery. It is amazing to see scientific
          discoveries, how they have been used to improve our daily lives.

              History documentaries deepen my understanding of past civilizations, conflicts, and movements. They remind me how history repeats 
          itself and how much we can learn from our predecessors. History is crucial in understanding the present day, why things unfold the ways
          they do now, and this understanding assists us in finding resolutions, for instance, tribal conflicts in Africa like the unrest 
          currently going on in the Eastern DRC.

              News keep me grounded in present realities. I follow global news networks to understand political shifts, economic trends, and 
          social movements that shape our world. This awareness enhances my ability to engage in thoughtful discussions.

              Technology-focused documentaries help me keep up with innovations in AI, cybersecurity, renewable energy, and digital culture. 
          They provide insights into how technology transforms societies—and how we can adapt. It is fascinating to see how technology and
          engineering evolve over time, from the seven wonders of the world to the current engineering marvels [shown in the video below].
